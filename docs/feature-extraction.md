# Feature Extraction

`functime` has over 100+ time-series feature extractors (e.g. `binned_entropy`, `longest_streak_above_mean`) available for any `Polars` Series. Approximately 85% of the implementations are optimized lazy queries and works on both `polars.Series` and `polars.Expr`.

Check out the [API reference](ref/feature-extraction.md) for a list of supported feature extractors.
