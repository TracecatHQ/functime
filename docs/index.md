## Production-ready time series models

**functime** is a machine learning library for time-series predictions that [just works](https://www.functime.ai/).

- **Fully-featured:** Powerful and easy-to-use API for [forecasting](#forecasting-highlights) and [feature engineering](#feature-engineering-highlights) (tsfresh, Catch22).
- **Fast:** Forecast and classify [100,000 time series](#global-forecasting) in seconds *on your laptop*
- **Cloud-native:** Instantly run, deploy, and serve predictive time-series models
- **Efficient:** Embarressingly parallel feature engineering using [Polars](https://www.pola.rs/) *
- **Battle-tested:** Algorithms that deliver real business impact and win competitions

## Installation

Check out this [guide](installation.md) to install functime. Requires Python 3.8+.

## Supported Data Schemas

!!! info "Panel Data"

    Forecasters, preprocessors, and splitters take a **panel dataset** where the first two columns represent entity (e.g. commodty name) and time (e.g. date). Subsequent columns represent observed values (e.g. price). The panel DataFrame **must be sorted by entity, time.**

    ```
    >>> y_panel
    shape: (47_583, 3)

    commodity_type   time         price

    ```

!!! info "Time Series"

    (COMING SOON) Feature extractors support both **panel** and **time-series** DataFrames.

## Forecasting

Point and probablistic forecasts using machine learning.
Includes utilities to support the full forecasting lifecycle:
preprocessing, feature extraction, time-series cross-validation / splitters, backtesting, automated hyperparameter tuning, and scoring.

- Every forecaster supports **exogenous features**
- **Backtesting** with expanding window and sliding window splitters
- **Automated lags and hyperparameter tuning** using [`FLAML`](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML)
- **Probablistic forecasts** via quantile regression and conformal prediction
- **Forecast metrics** (e.g. MASE, SMAPE, CRPS) for scoring in parallel
- Supports **recursive and direct** forecast strategies
- **Censored model** for zero-inflated forecasts

## Quick Examples

### Forecasting

```python
import polars as pl
from functime.cross_validation import train_test_split
from functime.feature_extraction import add_fourier_terms
from functime.forecasting import linear_model
from functime.preprocessing import scale
from functime.metrics import mase

# Load commodities price data
y = pl.read_parquet("https://github.com/descendant-ai/functime/raw/main/data/commodities.parquet")
entity_col, time_col = y.columns[:2]

# Time series split
y_train, y_test = y.pipe(train_test_split(test_size=3))

# Fit-predict
forecaster = linear_model(freq="1mo", lags=24)
forecaster.fit(y=y_train)
y_pred = forecaster.predict(fh=3)

# functime ❤️ functional design
# fit-predict in a single line
y_pred = linear_model(freq="1mo", lags=24)(y=y_train, fh=3)

# Score forecasts in parallel
scores = mase(y_true=y_test, y_pred=y_pred, y_train=y_train)

# Forecast with target transforms and feature transforms
forecaster = linear_model(
    freq="1mo",
    lags=24,
    target_transform=scale(),
    feature_transform=add_fourier_terms(sp=12, K=6)
)
```

### Splitters
View API reference for [`functime.cross_validation`](https://docs.functime.ai/ref/cross-validation/).
`functime` currently supports expanding window and rolling window splitters.
Splitters are used for cross-validation and backtesting.

### Preprocessing
View API reference for [`functime.preprocessing`](https://docs.functime.ai/ref/cross-validation/).
Preprocessors take in a `polars.DataFrame` or `polars.LazyFrame` as input and **always returns a `polars.LazyFrame`**.
No computation is run until the collect() method is called on the LazyFrame.
This allows Polars to [optimize the whole query](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars-book/user-guide/lazy/optimizations/) before execution.

```python
from functime.preprocessing import boxcox, impute

# Use df.pipe to chain operations together
X_new: pl.LazyFrame = (
    X.pipe(boxcox(method="mle"))
    .pipe(detrend(method="linear"))
)
# Call .collect to execute query
X_new: pl.DataFrame = X_new.collect(streaming=True)
```

View [quick examples](preprocessing.md) of time-series preprocessing with `functime`.

## Time Series Data

### Feature Engineering

Easily enrich your forecasts with calendar effects, holidays, weather patterns (coming soon), economic data (coming soon), and seasonality features (i.e. Fourier Series).
View API reference for [`functime.feature_extraction`](https://docs.functime.ai/ref/feature-extraction/).
